         I'm a Fullstack Web Developer from Sinaloa, Mexico, based in Atlanta, Georgia. Green card holder. <br />
         I graduated from university in Mexico in 2018 as an Information Systems Engineer
         and ever since I discovered the Web Development area I fell in love with it and I've been learning everything I can
         about it. I'm a fast learner and I'm always looking to improve my skills.
         I started a small website business this last year creating pages with Wordpress, Elementor and code.
